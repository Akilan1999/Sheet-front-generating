## Why do we have this Repo?

The Concept of IOE is that anyone can buy electricity from anyone. Once a transaction is successful there must be a way to transfer electricity. This code will run on a raspberry pi and using relays it will control the flow of electricity.

#### The Installation .md file coming soon
